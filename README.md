# RIThesisTemplate

This is a basic LaTeX template for a Thesis. It uses the `subfiles` package 
so each chapter can be compiled separately. Provides examples for writing 
optimization problems, including tikz files (including externalization),
various equation formats, and algorithms. 

My LaTeX editor of choice is VSCode, using the TeX Workshop extension.  It
allows you to easily compile the chapters individually and works out-of-the-box
with the subfiles package. I also like using the "Hide Gitignored" extension to
de-clutter my folder view. It also allows you to use Vim and/or Emacs when
editing LaTeX, which in my opinion makes your life much easier (e.g. `vip`
followed by `gq` to reformat entire paragraphs).

This is a first pass at creating a template from my own Thesis, 
and still has some work left to do, but it should get you started.
I've tried to use fairly standard methods for LaTeX, so it should 
be pretty easy to follow. Submit issues or PRs with suggestions!
